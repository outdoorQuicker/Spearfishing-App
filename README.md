# Spearfishing-App
Describes and calculates ideal spearing conditions
Goal: Connect to tide, wind, swell, and rain forecast databases to calculate ideal ocean conditions for spearfishing.  
We want the app to simply tell the user, "Yes, go spearfishing" or "No, the conditions are not great today". 
We want to use tide, wind, swell and rain databases because these factors all have an effect on the water clarity (visbility) and the overall choppiness of the waves.  
We want to have this app cover all of southern california, with the eventual goal of covering the whole west coast, then east coast.
